A collection of tiny Sudoku solvers

## What?

Sometime back in 2006, Mark Byers started collecting and tracking the shortest Sudoku solvers in a variety of programming languages on the web. It was a cool page (and one I had a vested interest in since I had a hand in the Java solver) but sadly dropped off the web sometime in 2008. With Mark’s permission, I’m re-instating the content here and declaring it re-open for submissions - if you can improve on the solvers below or contribute a solver in a new language, please do!

## Notes

 * Programs should not contain lines longer than 80 characters. If the language allows splitting a long line into two shorter lines, using this feature is acceptable.

 * For compiled languages, source code size is counted, not compiled size.

 * New line characters are counted as one byte.

 * A valid program can accept any 9x9 Sudoku from standard input (or else the first command line parameter, if you prefer) and should output the result to standard out. I will also list some of the programs that cheat very slightly (for example, by outputing to standard error instead of standard out).

 * If command line parameters are required, they are counted as extra bytes using the perlgolf counting rules.
