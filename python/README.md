##Contributors

 * The original python program of length 178 bytes was written by Mark Byers, with help from marienz and Random832, originally based on the Perl program above.
 * David Warren changed `‘%d’%5**18` to `14**7*9` which reduced the program to 177 bytes (and also improves the performance of the algorithm).
 * Yu-Xi Lim suggested using `raw_input()` and `input()` which reduced the clean version to 169 bytes and the ‘cheating’ version to 155 bytes.
