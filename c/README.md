##Notes on the solution
The program also compiles and runs successfully in Microsoft Visual Studio.

Oli also pointed out that this program is not strictly legal C, and suggested another slightly longer [version](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dps/4407942/raw/d5423637068abd01d469a802e7ea33268f0b7b23/sudoku.c) (198 bytes) that is legal C.

##Contributors

 * The first C version was 340 bytes, provided by David Barr.
 * Oli Charlesworth then sent a 272 bytes version, and later reduced it to 190, and then 176 bytes.
 * Joel Hockey knocked another 2 bytes off.
